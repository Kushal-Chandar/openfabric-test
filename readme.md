# Openfabric Test Solutions

I have 3 solutions as of now but I can implement two solutions with complete confidence and I am still learning about model training my own models and there is also a lack of my availability.

## Solution 1

This involves having rules / having a dictionary which map key words to text and from there with get each word in the question and get the string related to the keyword and formulate an answer.

## Solution 2

Use a pretrained model from hugging face, giving it context on science based text and have it generate the response. This works well as the i have modified the code a big so that the chatbot can learn from the context you provide.

## Solution 3

Train our custom model using pytorch / tensorflow and create the model. I am currently unable to implement this approach due to a lack of time.
